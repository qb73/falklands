		<h2>The Invasion</h2>
		<p>The Falklands War, known by many other names, was a conflict between the Parliamentary British Government and the Dictatorial Argentine Government. The conflict was centered at the Falkland Islands, only 945 miles away, whilst Britain operated from over an 8,000 mile operation. The war began on April 2nd, 1982, with the Argentine invasion of the islands and the capturing its capital, Port Stanley. Sea and aerial efforts raged for a weeks, to which many British vessels were destroyed through Argentine-controlled french-made excocet missiles. By May 21st the British military had created a beachhead from which they would reconquer the British Isle. After heavy fighting, and the hundreds of casualties inflicted by both sides, the British captured Port Stanley, and entered peace negotiations with them. The war ended on June 14th, 1982.
