		<h2>Ground Combat</h2>
		<p>After the two previous phases, both navally and aerially controlling space in and around the Falkland Islands, they finally comitted ground troops. Through a previous sinking of ships, one that carried helicopters and otber vehicles had been lost, to which the soldiers on the ground had to march to many places, including towards the eventual capture of Port Stanley. Often, British troops were outnumbered but with high skill, whereas the horde of conscripted soliders, bearly receiving training, were still beaten nevertheless. The most notable battles ocurred at Goose Green, as well as in and around Port Stanley. As the capture of Port Stanley, the war was over. In the end, the British were infliced with 255 casualties, the argentines ranging in the 11000s. Overall, the British took the island with tough resistance and prevailed, whilst the lies the Argentines were told, and lost a war they were overconfident to win. Shortly after the war ended, the defeated populous targeted Galtieri, and ousted him as their leader. The rivalry between Argentina and Britain still rages to this day.</p>
