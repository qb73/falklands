		<h2>8,064 Miles Away</h2>
		<p>The Falklands took place on the Falkland Islands, with Argentina only being 945 miles away. Britain, however, was 8,064 miles away. The logistics of that disadvantage were great, where the entire fleet took days to get to ascension island (a forward operating base for the British invasion), with traveling another ~3,500 miles to get to the Falklands itself. As a method to prevent as much death as possible, the British created a exclusion zone. Before they invaded the Falklands, they had to achieve three phases. The Frist phase was naval control, which was easily won by the British after the sinking of ARA General Belgrano. The ship's sinking resulted in 323 Argentines, and the withdrawl of all naval forces. The second phase was controlling the skies.
