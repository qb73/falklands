		<h2>Aerial Superiority</h2>
		<p>The second phase for the British was aerial superiority. Before they could land troopers, Britain had to ecrue the skies, through which was a tough undertaking. Since the arrivial of British naval forces, French-made Super Etendard jet strike fighters had sunk many ships with exocet missiles. If Britain was going to see through a landing invasion, they would need to control Falklands airspace. As the last of those aircraft were destroyed, the British began setting their sights on a land invasion at San Carlos.
